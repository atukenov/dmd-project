# AI Agent Instructions for Local Business Platform ‚Äî –ê—Ç—ã—Ä–∞—É

This guide helps AI coding agents understand the project's architecture, patterns, and conventions.

## üèó Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js-based platform for local businesses in Atyrau, Kazakhstan, with these key components:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand/React Query
- **Backend**: NestJS/Express server
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Auth**: Auth.js
- **Payments**: Kaspi QR integration
- **Notifications**: Telegram/WhatsApp API (via Twilio)

## üìä Data Model

Key collections and relationships (see `docs/documentation/databaseSchema.md`):

- `Users` ‚Üê `Businesses` (1:1)
- `Businesses` ‚Üê `Services` (1:many)
- `Businesses` ‚Üê `Clients` (1:many)
- `Appointments` (links `Clients`, `Services`, `Businesses`)
- `Payments` (tracks transactions)

## üîÑ Core Workflows

Key workflows (see `docs/documentation/workflows.md`):

1. **Business Owner Flow**:

   - Registration and login
   - Setup business profile (address, hours, services)
   - Configure Kaspi QR for payments
   - Manage appointments via admin calendar
   - Send client reminders
   - Track completed visits

2. **Client Flow**:

## üõ† Development Guidelines

### Project Structure

Frontend (`docs/documentation/frontendStructure.md`):

- `/app/` - Next.js App Router pages organizing:
  - Business owner dashboard (stats, clients, appointments)
  - Client booking flows
  - Authentication pages
- `/components/` - Reusable React components (grouped by feature):
  - Dashboard components
  - Client management
  - Appointment calendar
  - Service management
  - Payment integration
  - Settings & configuration
- `/lib/` - Shared utilities

Backend:

- `/src/` - NestJS/Express server code
- `/api/` - API route handlers
- `/models/` - MongoDB schemas
- `/services/` - Business logic layer

### Conventions

1. **API Routes**:

   - Use MongoDB schemas from `databaseSchema.md`
   - Include proper error handling

   - Use Tailwind for styling
   - Implement responsive design for mobile-first experience and desktop

   - Use Zustand for global state
   - React Query for API data

### Testing

- Unit tests for API routes
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright
